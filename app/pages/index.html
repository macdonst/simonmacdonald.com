      Hi — I’m <span class='font-semibold'>Simon MacDonald</span><br /> </h1>

      <p>
        I’m a Staff Software Engineer at <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity</a> where I work on a secret project that I'm not sure if I can talk about publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been building web applications for over twenty-five years and I've worked on a variety of projects including object oriented databases, encrypted communication systems, speech recognition and unified messaging.

        I remember when server-side rendering meant you were using shell scripts in cgi-bin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have nightmares about those dark days.
