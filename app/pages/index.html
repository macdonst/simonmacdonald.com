      Hi — I’m <span class='font-semibold'>Simon MacDonald</span><br /> </h1>

      <p>
        I’m the Head of Developer Experience at <a href="https://begin.com">Begin</a> where I contribute to open source projects like <a href="https://arc.codes">Architect</a> and <a href="https://enhance.dev/">Enhance</a> that enable developers to create functional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been building web applications for over twenty-five years and I've worked on a variety of projects including object oriented databases, encrypted communication systems, speech recognition and unified messaging.

        I still remember when server-side rendering meant you were using shell scripts in cgi-bin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have nightmares about those dark days.
