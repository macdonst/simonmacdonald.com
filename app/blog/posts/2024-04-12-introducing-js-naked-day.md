Earlier this week the web celebrated [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/) on April 9th. It is a day in which websites remove their CSS to show off the wonders of semantic HTML. The topic became quite popular on the fediverse leading [Zach Leatherman](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat) to suggest a JS Naked Day.

[![Zach](/_public/images/jsnakedday-zach.png "Itâ€™s #CSSNakedDay! I love this trendâ€”it highlights the importance of a foundation of good HTML. We need a similar one for JavaScript! #JSNakedDay should be April 10 ðŸ˜…")](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/112242172947339214)

Then [Ryan McNeely](https://indieweb.social/@McNeely) suggested we hold JS Naked Day on April 13th in honour of the HTTP error code 413 - Content Too Large.

[![Ryan](/_public/images/jsnakedday-ryan.png "@zachleat modern JS should celebrate #JSNakedDay on April 13th")](https://indieweb.social/@McNeely/112242192682793197)

Not to be out punned I suggested April 24th for the HTTP error code 424 - Failed Dependency because your website shouldn't completely fail if JavaScript is disabled.

[![Simon](/_public/images/jsnakedday-simon.png "@jgarber @zachleat @McNeely Shouldn't we do April 24th? That way it maps to 424, the failed dependency error code. Let's see what pages are independent of JS.")](https://mastodon.online/@macdonst/112247534020029958)

That suggestion seemed to gain consensus and had the added benefit of adding a few more days between CSS Naked Day and JS Naked Day.

So please [join us](https://js-naked-day.org/#participate) in celebrating [JS Naked Day](https://js-naked-day.org/) on April 24th either by removing all JavaScript on your site for that day or try surfing the web with JavaScript disabled. Add your participating site to [js-naked-day.org](https://js-naked-day.org) by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/macdonst/js-naked-day.org/blob/main/app/pages/2024.html) and tag your posts with #JSNakedDay.
