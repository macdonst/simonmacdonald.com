In just over a month I'll be headed to [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en/2024) in Montreal. On February 20th I'll be leading a [full day workshop](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/enhance-full-stack-workshop) on [Enhance](https://enhance.dev/).

> The Enhance Fullstack Workshop is designed for developers. You will learn how to build a full-stack web application (client and server) using Enhance powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). You'll leave with the skills required to construct multi-page dynamic web apps that leverage the platform while avoiding so-called "modern" tools that layer on complexity and unnecessary weight.

Then I'll be sticking around for the rest of the conference where I'll be giving two presentations:

1. [Sustainable Web Development](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/sustainable-web-development) - Feb 22nd
1. [Building Design Systems with Web Components](https://confoo.ca/en/2024/session/building-design-systems-with-web-components) - Feb 23rd

I'm excited to get back to Montreal to hang out with old friends and make new ones. Anyone want to take in the Habs vs Buffalo on Feb 21st? üèí
