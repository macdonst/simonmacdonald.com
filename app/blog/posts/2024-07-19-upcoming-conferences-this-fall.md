Fall conference season is once again upon us and I'll speaking at a bunch over the next few months. If you are going to be in or around any of these conferences please reach out on Mastodon or LinkedIn (see links below) so we can catch up.

## State of the Browser

It is my second straight year attending [State of the Browser](https://2024.stateofthebrowser.com/) and this year I was able to get [Begin](https://begin.com) to commit to being a [sponsor](https://2024.stateofthebrowser.com/sponsors/). I had an absolute blast attending the conference last year which you can read about [here](https://simonmacdonald.com/blog/posts/2023-09-25-state-of-the-browser-2023-trip-report). Fortunately, this year I'll be able to hang around London for more than 36 hours so I'm looking forward to catching up with friends.

**When:** September 14

**Where:** London, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

## Prairie Dev Con Winnipeg

[Prairie Dev Con Winnipeg](https://www.prairiedevcon.com/winnipeg.html) is part of a series of conferences put on in Calgary, Regina and Winnipeg by [D'Arcy Lussier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darcylussier/). D'Arcy puts on a great conference bringing in speakers from everywhere for the under served prairie market. This will be my 3rd appearance at the Winnipeg event and I'm looking forward to once again connecting with the community that D'Arcy has built.

**When:** September 23-24

**Where:** Winnipeg, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

## Web Unleashed

[Web Unleashed](https://fitc.ca/event/webu24/) is probably the closest I can get to a _local_ conference as it is only a quick train ride away for me. I've always enjoyed this conference as Shawn and his team do a great job of attracting top level talent. I mean who wouldn't want to attend a conference with Rachel Andrew, Chris Coyier, Henri Helvetica, etc.

**When:** October 10-11

**Where:** Toronto, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
