Reminded of this idea by [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.website/published/newsletters-that-regularly-hit-my-inbox-these-days/) who stole it from [Marc Thiele](https://marcthiele.com/notes/newsletter-that-regularly-hit-my-inbox-these-days). Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and all that.

I've really cut back on my social media consumption over the past couple of years. I still keep up to date with my Mastodon feed which feels very much like early Twitter where things were more signal than noise. For RSS feeds I love [Tapestry](https://usetapestry.com/) but there are a few mailing lists that I never skip.

## Newsletters

### Labnotes (by Assaf Arkin)

> *Tools and products you should know about, tips about UX, management, infosec; random and funny stuff*

I've been reading this [newsletter](https://labnotes.org/) since 2019 and never miss flipping through an issue. Assaf does a great job of curating this Weekend Reading newsletter that includes sections on Tech, Business, Design and Humour. No matter how busy I get reading this one email per week helps me stay up to date with nearly everything I care about.

### Dense Discovery (by Kai Branch)

> *Every week, DD brings together a compact collection of links across disciplines – from design, tech, art, urbanism, sustainability and more.*

I'm not a designer and I don't even play one on TV. People who know me would not praise me for my design sense. In fact I often lean into ugly websites so designers will take pity on me and help make things beautiful. Hat tip to [Cole Peters](https://colepeters.com/) for the design of this site.

Anyway, [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/) is another newsletter I've been reading for a very long time (2020). I'd say I always learn something while reading Kai's newsletter and I have gotten so many great book recommendations over the years.

## What newsletters are you reading?

Two newsletters? That's it? Yup, sure is. I cut way back on all the emails I was getting from various sources. Please let me know what ones you think I should be reading. Particularly, if they can keep me up to date on new books.
