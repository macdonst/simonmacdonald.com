I purchased [_Web Accessibility Cookbook: Creating Inclusive Experiences_](https://accessibility-cookbook.com/) by [Manuel Matuzovic](https://front-end.social/@matuzo) back in late 2024 and when it arrived it went onto my stack of 200 plus books to read. It took me awhile to get to it because, _gestures wildly_, there's a lot going on.

Once I did start digging into it in early 2025, I really appreciated the way that each chapter is broken down into recipes that are easy to follow. Hence, the _cookbook_ in the title. As someone who cares about accessibility but is by no means an expert I found something useful in each recipe. So much so, that by section 1.5 I just stopped adding sticky notes to the book as I would quickly run out of stickies.

Then I had the opportunity to meet Manuel in person at [State of the Browser 2025](https://2025.stateofthebrowser.com/). I asked Manuel if he would sign my book if I schleped it all the way to London and he did not disappoint.

Returning home from London, I went back to reading a recipe a day to really absorb the book. Until I had a week of vacation in a remote cottage and needed some light reading.

At the cottage I continued to work my way through the book, dog earing more and more pages, especially in the chapters on navigation and forms. Then in chapter 12 I ran into this quote which honestly floored me.

    <img src="/_public/images/wac/quote.jpg" alt="Many experts, like Simon MacDonald, recommend carefully considering your use
case before reaching for the Shadow DOM by default (https://enhance.dev/blog/posts/2023-08-18-shadow-dom-not-by-default) because
eschewing Shadow DOM prevents the issues described in this recipe and in Recipe 12.1."/>

Chapter 12 on custom elements/web components is obviously near and dear to my heart and I thought Manuel covered it expertly.

In summary, I learned something new in every chapter ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ out of ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars and would highly recommend it for folks wanting to learn more about web accessibility.
