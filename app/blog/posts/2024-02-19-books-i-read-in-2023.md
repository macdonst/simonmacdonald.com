I'm super far behind my wrap up of books I read in 2023. Folks who are not aware of my insatiable need to read books may be surprised that I read well over 100 books a year. This year it broke down as 73 fiction, 47 non-fiction and 20 graphic novels or manga. What follows are the ones that I really thought stood out.

## Book of the Year

![Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](/_public/images/books/tomorrow-x3.jpg)

[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/690750/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-by-gabrielle-zevin/9780735243347) by [Gabrielle Zevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Zevin). Wow, what an unexpected gem. I saw this book on a bunch of best-read lists for 2022, and I was drawn in by the description. I thought I'd be reading a fictionalized version of the history of building video games, like Console Wars, but I got this beautiful book about friendship instead. The closest comparison I can make is The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay by Michael Chabon. Regardless, this book deserves all the accolades it has been receiving.

## Surprise of the Year

![Book Lovers](/_public/images/books/book-lovers.jpg)

[Book Lovers](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/670293/book-lovers-by-emily-henry/9780593440872) by [Emily Henry](https://www.emilyhenrybooks.com/). I didn’t realize this would be a romance novel when I started reading it. It was in a list of books recommended to me that were book/library related. I don’t normally read romance novels, so I can’t comment on the genre’s finer points, but I enjoyed the book. I see this becoming a rom-com movie someday, as it does a pretty good job of flipping the normal rom-com tropes on their head. The protagonist in Book Lovers is the high-powered career woman you hate in a regular “rom-com” and eventually is dumped in favour of the folksy hometown woman. Anyway, it was a funny book that is well worth the read.

## Mystery of the Year

![The Thursday Murder Club](/_public/images/books/the-thursday-murder-club.jpg)

2023 was a year where I read way more mystery novels than I usually do. Consequently it led me to the incredibly popular [The Thursday Murder Club](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/633983/the-thursday-murder-club-by-richard-osman/) by [Richard Osman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Osman). This novel series centers around four septuagenarians who like to solve murders from their retirement home in England. The mystery is not as difficult or solvable as I would hope but the book rises and falls on it's excellent cast of characters.

## Graphic Novel/Manga of the Year

![Spy X Family Vol 1](/_public/images/books/spy-x-family.jpg)

For me it has to be [Spy X Family](https://spy-x-family.fandom.com/wiki/Spy_x_Family_Wiki) by [Tatsuya Endo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuya_Endo). Let me just give you the elevator pitch and if you are not hooked I don't know what to tell you.

_Loid Forger aka Twilight a super-spy needs to build a fake family in order to complete his latest mission. So he adopts a young child, Anya, from an ophanage. Unknown to Twilight, Anya is secretly a telepath. In order to round out the family Twilight meets a young lady, Yor, who agrees to become his "fake" wife but of course Yor has her own secrets as she as an expert assassin, the Thorn Princess._

I mean hilarity ensues as they try to be a family while keeping their secrets from one another.

## Non-fiction Book of the Year

![The Creative Act](/_public/images/books/the-creative-act.jpg)

[The Creative Act](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/) by [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin). This book is like a collection of zen koans for creativity. It can be enjoyed as one continuous read like I did the first time or by reading one idea per day and sitting with it as I'm doing currently.
