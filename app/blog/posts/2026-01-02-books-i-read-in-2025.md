This year I regressed to the mean and read 149 books. It breaks down to be 71 fiction, 40 non-fiction and 38 more graphic novels/manga.

## Book of the Year

[The Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightingale_(Hannah_novel)) by [Kristin Hannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Hannah).

_Gut punch. Swerve. Gut punch. Repeat._

There are books you admire, and then there are books that emotionally body‑check you into the boards. The Nightingale is firmly in the second category. Just when you think you understand the shape of the story, it swerves, hits you again, and somehow still finds room for beauty and humanity.

What really landed for me was how relentlessly personal it is. This isn’t history as a backdrop; it’s history as lived experience, with all the fear, courage, and impossible choices that come with it. I don’t cry easily at books, but this one got me more than once. A devastating, unforgettable read.

## Technical Book of the Year

[Web Accessibility Cookbook](https://accessibility-cookbook.com/) by [Manuel Matuzovic ](https://front-end.social/@matuzo).

I’ve already [written at length](./2025-08-20-book-review-web-accessibility-cookbook) about Web Accessibility Cookbook, so I won’t rehash the whole thing here — but it absolutely deserves a spot on this list.

What sets this book apart is how practical it is without ever being shallow. The recipe format makes it easy to dip into, but each section still takes the time to explain why something matters, not just how to implement it. As someone who cares deeply about accessibility but doesn’t pretend to be an expert, I learned something in every single chapter.

Also, any book that manages to both teach me new things and quote my own work back at me earns eternal goodwill.

## Graphic Novel/Manga of the Year

![My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Vol 1](/_public/images/books/monsters.png)

[My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Vol 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Thing_Is_Monsters) by [Emil Ferris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Ferris)

This book is a gut punch in an entirely different way.

My Favorite Thing Is Monsters feels raw and unfiltered, like you’re reading someone’s private sketchbook and diary at the same time. The art is messy in the most intentional way, and the story drifts between horror, grief, identity, and obsession without ever feeling disjointed.

It’s one of those graphic novels that fully understands the medium — there are moments that simply wouldn’t work as prose. I finished it feeling unsettled, impressed, and very glad I read it.

## Non-fiction Book of the Year

![Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It](/_public/images/books/enshitification.jpg)

[Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It](https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/) by [Cory Doctorow](https://craphound.com/).

I read a lot of tech‑adjacent nonfiction, and most of it falls into one of two buckets: alarmist or overly academic. Enshittification manages to avoid both.

It puts a name to something we’ve all felt for years — platforms getting worse, incentives getting darker, users slowly becoming the product — and then methodically explains why this keeps happening. What I appreciated most is that it doesn’t just rant; it connects economics, policy, and product decisions into a system that suddenly makes depressing amounts of sense.

I finished this book feeling annoyed at this world we built. I'm not saying it is the reason I started collecting records but it certainly pushed me in that direction. It's just nice to be able to *own* your music again.

As an added bonus I got to chat with Cory when his book tour came through Ottawa.
