This year I went a bit nuts reading books topping out at 173 books in 2024. It breaks down to be 75 fiction, 47 non-fiction and 51 more graphic novels/manga. That's a big increase in comics since I got around finishing off the last 15 or so volumes of Naruto and starting in on Spy X Family.

## Book of the Year

![Hydrogen Sonata](/_public/images/books/sonata.jpg)

[Hydrogen Sonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hydrogen_Sonata) by [Ian M Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks). Whelp, I've been avoiding this book for over ten years now. I knew that once I read it there would be not more "new" Culture novels for me. In a way I'm glad that I did wait, the impact of reading this book hits harder with a decade of more wisdom. I completed this book after re-reading one Banks book per month in 2024, which, IMHO is a fantastic way to consume all the Culture novels.

It is a sad sort of irony that this final Culture novel which deals with the Subliming of a civilization was being written while Banks was completely unaware that he was dying from gall bladder cancer.

## Surprise of the Year

![Between Two Fires](/_public/images/books/fires.png)

[Between Two Fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Two_Fires_(novel)) by [Christopher Buehlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buehlman). I had not heard of Buehlman before my buddy, [Taylor Beseda](https://tbeseda.com/), recommended me his books. It was my most pleasant surprise of the year as I quickly devoured the three I could get my hands on. _Between Two Fires_ is a historical fantasy set in France during the Black Death. Buehlman, who holds a degree in French language and history does an amazing job of bringing this period to life.

## Mystery of the Year

I continued reading a ton of mystery novels in 2024. While I enjoyed reading the Detective Kosuke Kindaichi series my favourite mystery novel of the year was actually also a sci-fi novel, [Station Eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Eternity) by [Mur Lafferty](https://murverse.com/). Besides this locked room mystery in a space station the protagonist has a very interesting _ability_ that makes her the prime suspect.

## Graphic Novel/Manga of the Year

![Naruto Vol 72](/_public/images/books/naruto.jpg)

[Naruto Vol 72](https://naruto-official.com/en/comics/01_154) by [Masashi Kishimoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masashi_Kishimoto) is the culmination of this long running manga series. No notes, perfect ending. Now if only _One Piece_ would finish up it's run.

## Non-fiction Book of the Year

![The Franchise: The Business of Building Winning Teams](/_public/images/books/franchise.jpg)

[The Franchise: The Business of Building Winning Teams](https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/The-Franchise/Craig-Custance/9781668035443) by [Craig Custance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Custance). A quasi follow up to _Behind the Bench_. This time Custance gets into the heads of NHL executives. Each chapter is a dive into what it takes to build a winner with a NHL GM or owner. While the book lends itself to reading one chapter at a time I did like how the author was able to string together a narrative that leads you from one exec to the next.
